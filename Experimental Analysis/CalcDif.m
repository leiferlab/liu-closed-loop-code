function Dif = CalcDif(Data, StepSize)			% StepSize MUST be > 0% This function calculates the (approx.) derivative of the vector *Data*. % % Alignment issues:% The function returns a vector (Dif) that is aligned with the input vector (Data).% This means that the i-th index of Dif is the value of the derivative % at the i-th index of Data. This value is calculated by taking the difference% between the values located StepSize/2 samples on either side of Data(i), % and dividing by StepSize.% Edge effects: See code (too long to explain & not that important).% Note: This function returns a value of the derivative in units of "dif"/samples.% To convert this measure to "dif"/seconds it is necessary to multiply Dif% by the sample rate.Len = length(Data);HalfStepHi = ceil(StepSize/2);HalfStepLo = floor(StepSize/2);Dif(1) = Data(2) - Data(1);for i = 2:HalfStepHi	Dif(i) = (Data(2*i-1) - Data(1)) / (2*i-2);endDif(HalfStepHi+1:Len-HalfStepLo) = (Data(StepSize+1:Len) - Data(1:Len-StepSize))/StepSize;for i = 1:HalfStepLo-1	Dif(Len-HalfStepLo+i) = (Data(Len) - Data(Len-2*HalfStepLo+2*i))/(2*HalfStepLo-2*i);endDif(Len) = Data(Len) - Data(Len-1);
