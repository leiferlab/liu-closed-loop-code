,,General instructions:,
,,1) These are analysis scripts to generate the plots in the manuscript.,
,,2) Please refer to the README.md in the GitHub repo to know more about the analysis steps and datasets.,
,,3) First all of the data needs to be downloaded from the ieee-dataport and the Github repo needs to be cloned.,Link to ieee-dataport: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/t6b0-bc36
,,4) Next the preprocessing script `/ProcessDateDirectory.m' needs to be run on a hgh performance computing cluster.,Link to GitHub repo: https://github.com/leiferlab/liu-closed-loop-code.git
,,Once the post processing analysis is finished then follow the below steps:,
,,1) Run the matlab script listed in the table:,
,,"2) The script 'plot_Figures_2_3_S1_S3_S4_S6.m' will ask the user for the figure panels to generate. The user can select 'Figure 2' to specify the plots shown in Figure 2. Note this doesn't specify which data is to be plotted, just which collection of plots to generate.",
,,"3) Next, select the datasets by selecting ""Tags"". The MATLAB script asks the user to select the Tags in the GUI.  Please refer above and select the correct set of tags to select the data included in the figure. This will make sure that the correct data folder are analyzed.",
,,"4) At the last step the user should select ""All Tags"" in the GUI for the script to start analyzing data. (despite the name, this just means it will analyze all of the *selected* tags)",
,,"5) Please note that for figure 4a, 4b, and S5, we have already analyzed the data and arranged them in .mat and .xlsx file. To generate these figures, the user can simply run the corresponding MATLAB script.",
